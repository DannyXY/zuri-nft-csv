```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, copy the csv file you want to format into the current directory

Run the command below to copy the example.env to a .env file and change the values to your own values

```bash
cp .example.env .env
```

```bash
node index.js
```

Once you're prompted to enter the path to the csv file, type the name of the file if it is in the directory, else write the relative/full path to the file
